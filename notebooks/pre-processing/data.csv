8559,0,an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and  worse  that you have to pay if you want to see it . ,37
8560,0,godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . ,37
8561,1,it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . ,37

8563,1,the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . ,37
8564,1,the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves  and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . ,37
8565,0,some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard  but he's the most obvious one . ,37
8566,1,the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . ,37
8567,0,though it goes further than both  anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here  but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . ,37
8568,0,it's not thirsty  consuming passion which drives this movie . no  it's the repetition of said behavior  and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad  more grating and boring than anything else . ,37
8569,1,even if you don't understand what on earth is going on this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . ,37
8570,1,it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . ,37
8571,0,at times  the suspense is palpable  but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . ,37
8572,0,the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . ,37
8573,0,as it stands  crocodile hunter has the hurried  badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla  which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . ,37

8588,1,this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . ,37
8589,1,greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . ,37
8590,0,watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another  you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . ,37
8591,0,this sade is hardly a perverse  dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery  and the film seems as deflated as he does . ,37
8592,0,with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work  especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent  but as is  personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . ,37
8593,0,will undoubtedly play well in european markets  where mr . besson is a brand name  and in asia  where ms . shu is an institution  but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . ,37

8595,1,it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians  another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . ,37
8596,0,well  jason's gone to manhattan and hell  i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey  don't shoot the messenger ) . ,37
8597,1,schepisi  aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one  ms . mirren  who did )  has succeeded beyond all expectation . ,37
8598,0,snoots will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey  but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . ,37
8599,1,moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still  he does all of this  and more  while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . ,37

8601,0,halfway through the movie  the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . ,37
8602,1,it may not be history � but then again  what if it is ? � but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . ,37

8604,1,it strikes hardest� when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact the world's political situation seems little different and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . ,37
8605,0,it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie  directed by scott kalvert  about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches  gratuitous violence  or empty machismo . ,37
8606,1,this filmed tosca -- not the first  by the way -- is a pretty good job  if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions  however  which bite cleaner  and deeper . ,37
8607,1,it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while  but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality,37

8611,0,the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent  we all could have stopped watching long ago . ,37
8612,0,even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . ,37
8613,0,i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games  of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . ,37

8616,1,most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it  so  hopefully  this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . ,37
8617,0,none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life  unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . ,37
8618,1,after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here  it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . ,37
8619,0,you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! ,37
8620,0,the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . ,37
8621,1,a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president  but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten  cynical journalists into what was essentially  by campaign's end  an extended publicity department . ,37
8622,1,you could say that it's slow at times you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . ,37
8623,1,anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy  repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . ,37
8624,1,disappointingly  the characters are too strange and dysfunctional  tom included  to ever get under the skin  but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue  visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . ,37
8625,0,the acting is stiff  the story lacks all trace of wit  the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . ,37
8626,1,as literary desecrations go this makes for perfectly acceptable occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday though and if they're old enough to have developed some taste so will your kids . ,37

8628,0,"it throws quirky characters  odd situations  and off-kilter dialogue at us  all as if to say  "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . ",37
8629,0,malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . ,37
8630,0,director brian levant  who never strays far from his sitcom roots  skates blithely from one implausible situation to another  pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . ,37
8631,0,[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional  even irritating ( at least to this western ear )  making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . ,37
8632,0,while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull  rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought  making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . ,37
8633,0,"given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same  we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster , this time  there isn't much . ",37
8634,1,not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books . ,37
8635,1,keenly observed and refreshingly natural  swimming gets the details right  from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach  s . c .  to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . ,37
8636,0,the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance  but twists are getting irritating  and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . ,37
8637,1,others more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' or more willing to see with their own eyes will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . ,37
8638,1,nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing  from her own screenplay  jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . ,37
8639,1,the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but � in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances  the film has � ironically - distanced us from the characters . ,37
8640,1,the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . ,37
8641,0,no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast  but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . ,37
8642,0,there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions  nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan  but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense  lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . ,38
8643,0,o �timo esfor�o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro  que  depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento  perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos s�o explicados . ,38

8648,1,colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you  burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . ,38
8649,1,about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more  houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant  irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . ,38
8650,1,in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating  genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills  the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . ,38

8886,1,the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships  including that between the son and his wife  and the wife and the father  and between the two brothers  with incredible subtlety and acumen . ,42
8887,0,whether it's the worst movie of 2002  i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded  and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise  mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . ,42
8888,1,jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can  but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . ,42
8889,1,it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon  dustin hoffman and holly hunter  yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . ,42

8893,0,the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly� alas  santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . ,43
8894,1,the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma  but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest  most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . ,43
8895,0,bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . ,43
8896,1,a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards  'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . ,43
8897,0,director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries  but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad  and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . ,43
8898,1,"it has a dashing and resourceful hero , a lisping  reptilian villain , big fights , big hair , lavish period scenery , and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . ",43

8900,0,though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director  this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit  with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . ,43
8901,1,if s&m seems like a strange route to true love  maybe it is  but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . ,43
8902,0,abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that  by the end  no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . ,43

8904,0,the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound  the lack of climax and  worst of all  watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . ,43
8905,1,notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour  i'm going to recommend secretary  based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal  and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-,43
8906,1,the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . ,43
8907,1,this is wild surreal stuff but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . ,43
8908,1,[clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined  but it has a tremendous  offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him  especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . ,43
8909,0,what you would end up with if you took orwell  bradbury  kafka  george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . ,43
8910,1,delia  greta  and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world  miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking  flawed humanity . ,43
8911,0,as an actor's showcase  hart's war has much to recommend it  even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment  the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . ,43
8912,1,'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen  but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . ',43
8913,0,it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic  the wife is patient  the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate  but short enough to make a dream seem possible . ,43
8914,0,anyway  for one reason or another  crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that  it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad  but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances  it's not a total loss . ,43
8915,1,spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here thankfully they are . ,43
8916,0,showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . ,43
8917,1,it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist  still committed to growth in his ninth decade  change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is  quite pointedly  about the peril of such efforts . ,43
8918,1,lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . ,43
8919,0,the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher  and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced  inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . ,43
8920,1,happily  some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front  look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls  retrospectively  his most personal work yet . ,43
8921,0,with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles  where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble  the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas  but it never manages to put them on the same path . ,43
8922,1,the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we today can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life his dignity and his music . ,43

8924,0,this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us  sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . ,43
8925,0,the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself  which feels  as it plods toward the end  less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . ,43
8926,1,you may be captivated  as i was  by its moods  and by its subtly transformed star  and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . ,44
8927,1,maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations  the movie passes inspection . ,44
8928,1,the stars may be college kids  but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed  overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . ,44

8933,1,in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family  forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . ,44
8934,1,[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . ,44
8935,1,i stopped thinking about how good it all was and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness gasping at its visual delights . ,44
8936,1,the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor  and when it does elect to head off in its own direction  it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . ,44

8939,1,[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living breathing part of the movie often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . ,44
8940,0,this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . ,44

8942,0,there is something in full frontal  i guess  about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them  but like most movie riddles  it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . ,44
8943,0,parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material  but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . ,44
8944,0,this rather unfocused  all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . ,44
8945,0,cinematic pyrotechnics aside  the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . ,44
8946,0,some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup  delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . ,44
8947,1,i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! ,44

8949,0,even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate  tiresome ugliness  it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . ,45
8950,0,an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak  former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future  that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . ,45
8951,0,as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type  more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script  which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . ,45
