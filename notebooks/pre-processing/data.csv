8552,0,herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable  but the notion that a strong  unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . ,36
8553,0,it's a stale  overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch  it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . ,36
8554,0,city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful  conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . ,36
8555,1,touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes  not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . ,36
8556,0,slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie  but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . ,36
8557,1,"it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel , her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . ",36
8558,1,though jackson doesn't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape  it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . ,36
8559,0,an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and  worse  that you have to pay if you want to see it . ,37
8560,0,godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . ,37
8561,1,it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . ,37
8562,1,a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man  and more about that man lost in its midst . ,37
8563,1,the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . ,37
8564,1,the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves  and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . ,37
8565,0,some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard  but he's the most obvious one . ,37
8566,1,the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . ,37
8567,0,though it goes further than both  anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here  but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . ,37
8568,0,it's not thirsty  consuming passion which drives this movie . no  it's the repetition of said behavior  and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad  more grating and boring than anything else . ,37
8569,1,even if you don't understand what on earth is going on this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . ,37
8570,1,it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . ,37
8571,0,at times  the suspense is palpable  but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . ,37
8572,0,the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . ,37
8573,0,as it stands  crocodile hunter has the hurried  badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla  which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . ,37

8577,1,k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories  but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . ,37
8578,1,like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism . ,37
8579,0,what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . ,37
8580,1,as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso  sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast  and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie  no matter who runs them . ,37
8581,0,while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest  the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization  humor or plain old popcorn fun . ,37
8582,0,for all its shoot-outs  fistfights  and car chases  this movie is a phlegmatic bore  so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian . ,37
8583,0,while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock  stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod  he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . ,37
8584,1,beating the austin powers films at their own game  this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . ,37
8585,1,nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women  emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . ,37
8586,0,see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned  you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . ,37
8587,1,many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside  and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . ,37
8588,1,this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . ,37
8589,1,greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . ,37
8590,0,watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another  you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . ,37
8591,0,this sade is hardly a perverse  dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery  and the film seems as deflated as he does . ,37
8592,0,with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work  especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent  but as is  personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . ,37
8593,0,will undoubtedly play well in european markets  where mr . besson is a brand name  and in asia  where ms . shu is an institution  but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . ,37

8595,1,it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians  another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . ,37
8596,0,well  jason's gone to manhattan and hell  i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey  don't shoot the messenger ) . ,37
8597,1,schepisi  aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one  ms . mirren  who did )  has succeeded beyond all expectation . ,37
8598,0,snoots will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey  but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . ,37
8599,1,moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still  he does all of this  and more  while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . ,37

8601,0,halfway through the movie  the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . ,37
8602,1,it may not be history ï¿½ but then again  what if it is ? ï¿½ but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . ,37
8603,1,"some of the most ravaging  gut-wrenching  frightening war scenes since "" saving private ryan "" have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war . ",37
8604,1,it strikes hardestï¿½ when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact the world's political situation seems little different and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . ,37
8605,0,it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie  directed by scott kalvert  about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches  gratuitous violence  or empty machismo . ,37
8606,1,this filmed tosca -- not the first  by the way -- is a pretty good job  if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions  however  which bite cleaner  and deeper . ,37
8607,1,it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while  but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality,37
8608,1,if you're not into the pokemon franchise this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . ,37
8609,1,reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior  it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . ,37
8610,0,despite bearing the paramount imprint  it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there,37
8611,0,the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent  we all could have stopped watching long ago . ,37
8612,0,even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . ,37
8613,0,i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games  of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . ,37
8614,0,a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director  tom dey  had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and  for that matter  shrek ) . ,37
8615,0,after a while  the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet  fuzzy and sticky . ,37
8616,1,most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it  so  hopefully  this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . ,37
8617,0,none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life  unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . ,37
8618,1,after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here  it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . ,37
8619,0,you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! ,37
8620,0,the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . ,37
8621,1,a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president  but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten  cynical journalists into what was essentially  by campaign's end  an extended publicity department . ,37
8622,1,you could say that it's slow at times you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . ,37
8623,1,anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy  repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . ,37
8624,1,disappointingly  the characters are too strange and dysfunctional  tom included  to ever get under the skin  but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue  visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . ,37
8625,0,the acting is stiff  the story lacks all trace of wit  the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . ,37
8626,1,as literary desecrations go this makes for perfectly acceptable occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday though and if they're old enough to have developed some taste so will your kids . ,37
8627,0,one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids  children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . ,37
8628,0,"it throws quirky characters  odd situations  and off-kilter dialogue at us  all as if to say  "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . ",37
8629,0,malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . ,37
8630,0,director brian levant  who never strays far from his sitcom roots  skates blithely from one implausible situation to another  pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . ,37
8631,0,[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional  even irritating ( at least to this western ear )  making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . ,37
8632,0,while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull  rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought  making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . ,37
8633,0,"given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same  we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster , this time  there isn't much . ",37
8634,1,not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books . ,37
8635,1,keenly observed and refreshingly natural  swimming gets the details right  from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach  s . c .  to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . ,37
8636,0,the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance  but twists are getting irritating  and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . ,37
8637,1,others more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' or more willing to see with their own eyes will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . ,37
8638,1,nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing  from her own screenplay  jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . ,37
8639,1,the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but ï¿½ in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances  the film has ï¿½ ironically - distanced us from the characters . ,37
8640,1,the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . ,37
8641,0,no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast  but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . ,37
8642,0,there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions  nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan  but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense  lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . ,38
8643,0,o ï¿½timo esforï¿½o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro  que  depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento  perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos sï¿½o explicados . ,38
8644,1,a tender and touching drama based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . ,38
8645,1,may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . ,38
8646,1,seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy  even though the reality is anything but . ,38
8647,0,"in a 102-minute film  aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the "" queen "" and less of the "" damned . "" ",38
8648,1,colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you  burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . ,38
8649,1,about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more  houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant  irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . ,38
8650,1,in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating  genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills  the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . ,38
8651,1,beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small sweet 'evelyn . ',38

8658,1,muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have  and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly  he is always sympathetic . ,38
8659,0,a tough go  but leigh's depth and rigor  and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness  offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . ,38
8660,0,christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists  who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . ,38
8661,0,hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . ,38
8662,0,instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid  we get an ugly  mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . ,38
8663,0,the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac  we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . ,38
8664,1,there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how  in the flip-flop of courtship  we often reel in when we should be playing out . ,38
8665,0,its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious  and schneider's performance is so fine  it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again  as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . ,38
8666,0,fails in making this character understandable  in getting under her skin  in exploring motivation . . . well before the end  the film grows as dull as its characters  about whose fate it is hard to care . ,38
8667,0,mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . ,38

8673,0,the latest installment in the pokemon canon  pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two  likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . ,38

8893,0,the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendlyï¿½ alas  santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . ,43
8894,1,the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma  but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest  most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . ,43

8896,1,a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards  'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . ,43
8897,0,director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries  but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad  and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . ,43

8900,0,though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director  this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit  with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . ,43
8901,1,if s&m seems like a strange route to true love  maybe it is  but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . ,43

8908,1,[clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined  but it has a tremendous  offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him  especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . ,43
8909,0,what you would end up with if you took orwell  bradbury  kafka  george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . ,43

8911,0,as an actor's showcase  hart's war has much to recommend it  even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment  the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . ,43

8914,0,anyway  for one reason or another  crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that  it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad  but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances  it's not a total loss . ,43
8915,1,spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here thankfully they are . ,43
8916,0,showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . ,43

8918,1,lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . ,43
8919,0,the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher  and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced  inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . ,43

8945,0,cinematic pyrotechnics aside  the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . ,44
